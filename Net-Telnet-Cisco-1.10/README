Net::Telnet::Cisco
------------------

DESCRIPTION

    Net::Telnet::Cisco adds additional functionality to 
    Net::Telnet that helps you automate Cisco router management
    and statistic gathering.


DOCUMENTATION

    POD style documentation is included with each module.
    This is normally converted to a manual page and installed
    as part of the <make install> process. You should also be
    able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract and read 
    documentation from the module file directly. See Changes 
    for recent changes.

    directly or indirectly, ever)
