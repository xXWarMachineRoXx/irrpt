<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A collection of tools which allow ISPs to easily track, manage, and
utilize IPv4 and IPv6 BGP routing information stored in Internet Routing
Registry (IRR) databases. Some of these tools include automated IRR data
retrieval, update tracking via CVS, e-mail notifications, e-mail based
notification for ISPs who still do human processing of routing information,
and hooks for automatically deploying prefix-lists on routers.</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>Internet Routing Registry (IRR) services have existed in various forms for
some time, yet many ISPs (particularly outside of the European/RIPE
region) have still not adopted it. There are a variety of reasons given,
but some of the most important ones include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The system is overly complicated, and lacks sufficient examples. End
users can not figure it out, which means another layer of support
structure must be added, or proxy registration must be implemented.</li>
<li>A publicly accessable description of every import and export policy
to every transit, peer, and customer, is difficult to maintain, and
is not in the best business interests of many ISPs.</li>
<li>There are no existing tools which provides registration change
tracking. Without this kind of tracking, there is not enough
accountability for prefix registrations, and router configuration
updates are difficult to manage.</li>
</ol>
<p>This tool takes a pragmatic approach, by focusing on the key elements and
critical goal of the IRR, in order to provide simple and effective prefix-
list management for the masses. To that end, IRR PowerTools aims to
provide the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated retrieval of prefixes registered behind an IRR Object.</li>
<li>Automatic exclusion of bogon or other configured undesirable routes.</li>
<li>Tracking and long-term recording of prefix changes through CVS.</li>
<li>Automatic aggregation to optimize data and reduce unnecessary changes.</li>
<li>E-mail updates, letting users know that their change was processed.</li>
<li>E-mail alerts to the ISP, letting them know of new routing changes.</li>
<li>Exporting of change data in e-mail form, for non-IRR using ISPs.</li>
<li>Router config generation, for easy automated config deployment.</li>
</ul>
<p>While many ISPs still rely on error-prone e-mail and human processing to
handle prefix-lists, a few have developed systems similar to this one in
order to automate their prefix-list management. Unfortunately each of
these systems is proprietary and owned by the respective ISPs, leaving
other networks with a choice between spending money and man-hours writing
duplicating this work, or more often taking the path of least resistance
and simply using e-mails and human processing.</p>
<p>This project aims to provide to every network the same features that
individual ISPs have been developing internally for years. By making it
easier for every ISP to effectively utilize the IRR data, we hope to
increase the popularity of the IRR as a prefix-list management tool, which
will hopefully lead to more accurate data and a more effective system.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>PHP          &gt;= 7.2.0   (<a href="http://www.php.net/downloads.php">http://www.php.net/downloads.php</a>)</li>
<li>CVS          Optional   (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/cvs/">http://www.gnu.org/software/cvs/</a>)</li>
<li>CVSweb       Optional   (<a href="http://people.freebsd.org/~scop/cvsweb/">http://people.freebsd.org/~scop/cvsweb/</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Make sure you have the required packages as listed above installed. Clone
the git respository in your desired install path via:
<a href="https://github.com/6connect/irrpt.git">https://github.com/6connect/irrpt.git</a>
Or, download the zip file and extract.
Run 'php configure.php' in the base installation directory.</p>
<p>To get started, you probably want to take a look at every file in
the /conf directory. The most important information to change will be
paths and company-specific information such as the name, ASN, and
e-mail addresses.</p>
<pre><code>irrpt.conf      - This is the master config file which contains global
                  configuration information, the paths to our internal
                  locations and external tools, and internal parameters.

irrdb.conf      - This is the second most important config file,
                  containing a list of the ASNs and IRR Objects you wish
                  to track.

nag.conf        - This file contains the settings for the nag process.

nag.msg         - This file contains the message that will be sent
                  during the nag process.

exclusions.conf - This file lists routes which can not be registered. A
                  good example for this file would be known bogon routes,
                  or routes in known unallocated space.
</code></pre>
<p>The irrdb.conf file should certain a unique ASN, the IRR object (an
AS-SET or AUT-NUM record) that you are interested in tracking, and a
contact e-mail for change notification. You probably want to track your
own ASN and AS-SET record here as well.</p>
<p>A reasonable deployment would be to crontab the fetch process once or
better yet twice a day. If you need to add a new customer outside of
the normal fetch schedule, or if a customer needs an emergency
prefix-list update, you can add the ASN/IRR Object to irrdb.conf and
run a manual pull of just that ASN, with &quot;./fetch ASN&quot;.</p>
<p>After the updates are processed, you should receive a local copy of the
e-mail. It is probably reasonable to keep a human being in the loop
between prefix fetching and prefix deployment, to make certain that
nothing &quot;bad&quot; or unintended is happening. After you are reasonably
certain that the changes are ready for deployment, you can generate
the router configs use the &quot;pfxgen&quot; tool. Optionally, you can nag
any of your transit providers who still require e-mail updates using
the nag process.</p>
<p>If there is anything else that you can't figure out, it is probably
either a bug or an oversight in the documentation. Send e-mail about
either one, and I'll make certain it gets addressed in a future
release.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>The operation of IRR PowerTools is broken down into the following distinct
operations:</p>
<h3 id="irrpt_fetch">irrpt_fetch</h3>
<pre><code>$ bin/irrpt_fetch -h
Usage: bin/irrpt_fetch [-h46qv] [-f file] [--nocvs] [object]
</code></pre>
<p>Quiet mode:</p>
<pre><code>$ bin/irrpt_fetch -q 42
...
</code></pre>
<p>Verbose mode:</p>
<pre><code>$ bin/irrpt_fetch -v 42
...
</code></pre>
<p>irrpt_fetch uses the list of objects provided by irrdb.conf by
default.  To track additional objects, simply add them to the
irrdb.conf file.  To fetch objects for a specific AS, or specific
object, provide this as an argument per the above example.</p>
<p>This is the stage where you pull data for the objects that you are
tracking off of the IRR, and store them locally. Inside the fetch
process, the following steps are performed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Query a IRR whois server for prefixes behind the IRR object.</li>
<li>Match prefixes (including more-specifics) against the Exclusions
list, which contains prefixes that can not be registered.</li>
<li>Store the approved prefixes locally.</li>
<li>Run the prefixes through an aggregation tool to optimize them.</li>
<li>Track changes to both the raw and aggregated prefix lists via CVS.</li>
<li>When changes are detected, send out notification e-mails to
customers and optionally a local copy to your operations staff,
alerting everyone that the routing change has been successfully
processed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="irrpt_nag">irrpt_nag</h3>
<pre><code>$ bin/irrpt_nag -h
Usage: bin/irrpt_nag [-hp] [-c config] [-m message] &lt;previous rev&gt; &lt;current rev&gt;

Options:
   -p    Preview mode (for diagnostic use). Print results to screen instead of
         e-mail.
</code></pre>
<p>In this stage, any transit providers (or other interested parties)
who still track prefix-list updates via e-mail rather than via IRR
can be notified of the change.</p>
<p>As more providers begin to use IRR, and rely on it as their primary
prefix tracking tool, this should become less and less necessary.
Unfortunately many of the largest ISPs still use human processing of
prefix lists, so for the immediate future you will probably still be
getting a lot of use out of this tool.</p>
<h3 id="irrpt_pfxgen">irrpt_pfxgen</h3>
<pre><code>$ bin/irrpt_pfxgen -h
Usage: bin/irrpt_pfxgen [-h46] [-p pfxstr] [-p6 pfxstr_v6] [-l pfxlength] [-l6 pfxlength_v6] [-f format] &lt;asn&gt;
  pfxstr       - The prefix-list name format string (default: CUSTOMER:%d)
  pfxstr_v6    - The prefix-list name format string (default: CUSTOMERv6:%d)
  pfxlength    - The max length more-specific that will be allowed (default: 24)
  pfxlength_v6 - The max length more-specific that will be allowed for v6 (default: 48)
  format       - The output format for a specific router type (default: cisco)
                 Currently supported values are:
                 cisco
                 ciscoxr
                 extreme
                 foundry
                 force10
                 juniper
                 edgeos
                 huawei
</code></pre>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>$ bin/irrpt_pfxgen -f cisco 42
...
$ bin/irrpt_pfxgen -f juniper 42
...
$ bin/irrpt_pfxgen -f extreme 42
...
$ bin/irrpt_pfxgen -f force10 42
...
$ bin/irrpt_pfxgen -f edgeos 42
...
$ bin/irrpt_pfxgen -f huawei 42
...
</code></pre>
<p>In this stage, actual router configurations are generated based on
the aggregated data we have stored. Currently only the following
formats are supported, but it should be trivial to add new ones:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cisco/Foundry format (and anyone else with a similar CLI)</li>
<li>Juniper format</li>
<li>Extreme format</li>
<li>Force10 format</li>
<li>EdgeOS format (Vyos/Vyatta should also work)</li>
<li>Huawei format</li>
<li>Openbgpd format</li>
<li>CiscoXR / iosxr format</li>
</ol>
<p>These configs can then be deployed automatically using a variety of
existing tools. Some of these tools include:</p>
<ul>
<li>JUNOScript         - <a href="http://www.juniper.net/support/junoscript/">http://www.juniper.net/support/junoscript/</a></li>
<li>JunOS PyEZ         - <a href="https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/day-one-books/topics/topic-map/how-to-automatically-update-prefix-lists.html">https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/day-one-books/topics/topic-map/how-to-automatically-update-prefix-lists.html</a></li>
<li>Net::Telnet::Cisco - <a href="http://NetTelnetCisco.sourceforge.net/">http://NetTelnetCisco.sourceforge.net/</a></li>
<li>Oxidized           - <a href="https://github.com/ytti/oxidized-script">https://github.com/ytti/oxidized-script</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Networks may find it appropriate to have an external database in place
which tracks customer BGP session data, so that you can search by a
customer name or ASN to automatically find and update only the necessary
routers and BGP sessions. This is also outside the scope of the current
project.</p>
<p>Juniper includes an example config pushing script in the JUNOSCript
package which works well, despite being a little complicated and having
something like 68 Perl dependancies.</p>
<p>Cisco can be configured a number of ways, including various perl
modules, expect scripts. Due to issues like CLI interactivity delays,
many users find that simply copying config updates via tftp is an easy
way to manage changes.</p>
<p>Many other systems exist as well.</p>
<h3 id="irrpt_list_prefixes">irrpt_list_prefixes</h3>
<p>Show prefixes for a given AS or AS-SET, in unaggregated or aggregated form.</p>
<pre><code>$ bin/irrpt_list_prefixes -h
Usage: bin/irrpt_list_prefixes [-h46va] &lt;object&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Pull unaggregated prefixes:</p>
<pre><code>$ bin/irrpt_list_prefixes AS-PCH
2a01:8840:4::/48
2a01:8840:5::/48

</code></pre>
<p>Pull aggregated prefixes:</p>
<pre><code>$ bin/irrpt_list_prefixes -a AS-PCH

</code></pre>
<p>Verbose mode:</p>
<pre><code>$ bin/irrpt_list_prefixes -v -a AS-PCH
...
- Aggregating routes - aggregating neighboring prefixes...

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<p>Q) Wouldn't this be more scalable if we stored our config and data in SQL?</p>
<p>A) Maybe it would. However, the purpose of this project is to open up the
world of automated IRR-based prefix-lists to every ISP. As such, it is
designed to be as simple as possible, with the fewest complex external
dependencies. A well organized network who maintains customer BGP info
in an existing database should be able to easily export their database
to our config format. It's the disorganized networks we really have to
worry about. :)  If you are dealing with so many prefixes that text
files are too slow, email one of the maintainers.</p>
<p>Q) Does this tool support RPSLng?</p>
<p>A) Not right now. This may change in the future (see the TODO file). Feel
free to let me know your strong interest (or lack thereof) on this issue.</p>
<p>Q) Does this tool generate AS-PATH filters?</p>
<p>A) No. Please note that this is not intended as an end-all and be-all
RPSL tool, or a total replacement for a utility like IRRToolSet. For
example, this tool does not try to parse aut-num import/export policies,
try to map every relationship between ASNs, try to write your entire
route-map for you. This is a pragmatic tool for helping ISPs easily do
what 95% of them need to do, namely handle prefixes registered behind a
specific IRR aut-num, route-set, or as-set object. Trying to support
every possible item which you can document with RPSL is best left to
academians and the pedantic.</p>
<h2 id="long-term-goals">Long Term Goals</h2>
<p>We understand that this is only one step in the direction of making IRR
truly and globally useful, but hopefully it will prove to be an important
one. The next logical step towards improving the overall user experience
would be to design an intuitive web interface for managing records in the
IRR, so that BGP speaking end-users are not required to learn the
complexities of RPSL in order to register their routes.</p>
<p>Hopefully this tool will prove to be useful to a variety of ISPs, and will
increase the adoption of IRR data over error-prone e-mail updates. When
more ISPs can make use of this data, and when more end-users are able to
easily make use of the system, there will hopefully be an increase in
accurate and maintained data and a reduction in the need to pollute the
IRR with proxy-registered junk.</p>
<p>More in the TODO file.</p>

</ul>
<p>1.28 - June 8 2015</p>
<ul>
<li>Making the latest version compatible with TORIX changes, such as: -q quiet
mode, timezone support and memory limit support by Elisa Jasinska
<a href="mailto:elisa@bigwaveit.org">elisa@bigwaveit.org</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>1.27 - Feb 8 2008</p>
<ul>
<li>Redesigned (and simplified) the CVS diff code. The options are now
&quot;fulldiff&quot; (basically the complete output of a normal CVS diff, that
you could actually use to patch a file), &quot;plusminus&quot; (stripped down
to only a list of prefix changes), and &quot;english&quot; (aka &quot;Cogent Mode&quot;,
for NOCs who can't quite figure out what the + and - symbols might
mean). This was supposed to have been done back in 1.20, but this
version actually makes it work.</li>
</ul>
<p>1.26 - June 8 2007</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added support for Force10 prefix-list format. The style is JUST
different enough from Cisco to be incompatible, you have to enter a
hierarchy under the prefix-list declaration and then enter the permit
lines seperately, rather than stating it all on one line. Thanks to
Greg Hankins for pointing this out and providing the fix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for 32-bit (4-byte) ASNs. The #.# format (who's stupid
idea was that anyways :P) was being detected as an IP address and the
result of a route-set. Added an additional check to make it detect as
an object to be be further queried, not that it will help since it
seems the IRRd software (which is the only protocol we support, for
various reasons) doesn't currently like importing this format either,
but at least it won't be IRRPT's fault when it doesn't work. :)</p>
<p>Thanks to: those wonderful euros who just had to actually go and try
those new ASNs out ASAP, thus killing all the Farce10 and JUNOS 8.3R1
boxes on the planet. Go go gadget incompatibility. :)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1.25 - May 27 2006</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added an option to automatically change uid/gid to a specified id if
run as root. CVS will not let you run as root, so you should have a
dedicated user anyways, but sometimes people forget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completely changed the way we process arguments, php getopt() sucks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a plethoa of bugs in irrpt_nag. I don't know how you guys were
even using this before, or why no one told me how broken this was
before now. :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changed the default subject line of irrpt_nag, put the ASN info in
the front for a quicker read on narrow terminals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1.24 - December 29 2005</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added an &quot;ASN list&quot; file which records the ASNs behind each object. This
may be used to implement some kind of AS-PATH filtering in the future I
suppose, though it really isn't the right tool for the job. Talked into
this evilness by Jon Nistor <a href="mailto:nistor@snickers.org">nistor@snickers.org</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a really silly mistake in the processing of &quot;english&quot; style output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a new tool &quot;irrpt_explorer&quot;, which queries and displays the
contents of an AS-SET in a hierarchal and recursive format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed some unnecessary code in irrpt_eval.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1.23 - November 18 2005</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Changed $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] references to <strong>FILE</strong> to work around
some portability issues with certain PHP builds (like apparently, RedHat).
Pointed out by Joshua Sahala <a href="mailto:jejs@sahala.org">jejs@sahala.org</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed the -p flag (preview mode) on irrpt_nag. It works better if you
actually have &quot;p&quot; in getopt(). Pointed out by Christian Malo
<a href="mailto:chris@fiberpimp.net">chris@fiberpimp.net</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1.22 - November 8 2005</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed irrpt_eval -a (aggregate) functionality. Pointed out by
Jon Nistor <a href="mailto:nistor@snickers.org">nistor@snickers.org</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for ExtremeWare prefix generation. Submitted by Tom
Hodgson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A documentation tweak noting that PHP &gt;= 4.3 is required. Submitted
by Tom Hodgson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a note regarding Debian's &quot;aggregate&quot; package to the README.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Got a little carried away getting rid of Nistor's strict errors. Rolling
some things back to continue supporting php 4, easier solution is just
not to turn on E_STRICT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added some example scripts for router configuration deployment. Updated
documentation to reflect these changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nailed down a few bugs with caching results that had incorrect array
indexes following sort and unique. Extensive troubleshooting by Jon
Nistor <a href="mailto:nistor@snickers.org">nistor@snickers.org</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a quick optimization to only parse the exclusions file once (well
most of the time at any rate).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A couple of minor bugfixes and documentation changes from the previous
release.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1.20 - November 7 2005</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added support for handling a route-set object, and revised the as-set code
to be a little more generic/graceful while handling it. Issue noted by
Jon Nistor <a href="mailto:nistor@snickers.org">nistor@snickers.org</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a new tool &quot;irrpt_eval&quot; which returns a simple plain-text list of
routes from an arbitrary IRR object, using the irrpt query engine. This
can be useful for diagnostics/quick lookups, and is similar to the
IRRToolSet tool &quot;peval&quot;. Requested by Aaron Weintraub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed some class definitions to comply with php strict mode. Contributed
by Jon Nistor <a href="mailto:nistor@snickers.org">nistor@snickers.org</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an IRR query fails, the query that resulted in the failure is now
displayed (verbose mode required). Nagged to death by Jon Nistor
<a href="mailto:nistor@snickers.org">nistor@snickers.org</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a config option for controlling the e-mail updates which are sent
when a route change is detected:</p>
<p>irrpt.conf: ['fetch']['emailonchange']</p>
<p>User can now specify whether to send emails for updated detected in the
&quot;full&quot; (unaggregated) route file, the &quot;aggregated&quot; route file, &quot;both&quot;
(default), or &quot;none&quot;. Requested by Jon Nistor <a href="mailto:nistor@snickers.org">nistor@snickers.org</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added an option for &quot;english&quot; language diff format. Apparently the Cogent
NOC can't figure out what &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; means, so &quot;english&quot; mode changes
the output to &quot;Add&quot; and &quot;Remove&quot; (and is the new default). There is
also an option to continue using + and - (&quot;plusminus&quot;) but to remove the
full &quot;diff&quot; headers. The old behavior is retained under the setting
&quot;fulldiff&quot;. Requested by Adam Rothschild.</p>
<p>irrpt.conf: ['diff']['output_format']</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a new flag &quot;-p&quot; to irrpt_nag, which enables preview mode. In
preview mode, the contents of the email(s) which would be sent are
output to stdout instead of being emailed. This allows you to
double-check the e-mails before actually sending them. Requested by
Adam Rothschild.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changed the format of ['pfxgen']['default_pfxname'], and renamed it to
default_pfxstr. It is now handled as a printf()-style format string, with
one argument (the ASN). For example, to generate &quot;CUSTOMER:1234&quot; use the
string: &quot;CUSTOMER:%d&quot;. Requested by Pierfrancesco Caci.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated the distributed (but commented out) example exclusions.conf, just
incase someone decides to uncomment it without obtaining the current
exclusions list themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bunch of small misc. changes in formatting and alignment. Largely
requested by Jon Nistor <a href="mailto:nistor@snickers.org">nistor@snickers.org</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1.10 - December 29 2004</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added an optional local cache for prefixes queried from an aut-num
record, under the assumption that many networks will have as-set
records which contain overlapping aut-num records. This will increase
memory usage a bit, but results in significantly faster queries from
the IRR whois servers for those with a large number of IRRDB entries.
Cache is enabled by default. Suggested by Arnold Nipper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug in the default CVS files which would cause an error
message when fetch is run from a directory other than the default
&quot;/usr/local/irrpt&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commented out the default bogon routes in the distributed exclusions
config file, so users must choose to explicitly enable it. Hopefully
this will prevent the blind use of potentially out of date bogon
information, and avoid unnecessary whining on mailing lists every
time a RIR is allocated a new /8.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1.00 - December 26 2004</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial public release.</li>
</ul>
